This project was done in the Scope of my Microcontrollers course in my University.
It wass created for the ARM M4 Cortex architecture and was tested on the Texas Instruments TM4C1294 Microcontroller.

The program utilises the 4 built-in LEDs on the Microcontroller to count from 0 to 15 in binary, where each LED represents a bit. If the LED is on, 
this represents a 1, while if it is off, this represents a 0. It keeps counting in a loop until manually stopped.
